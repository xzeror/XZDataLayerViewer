# XZDataLayerViewer

Debugging mobile application analytics could be hard. XZDataLayerViewer is a library that could help your analytic to see what data sent to Google Analytics from your app, if you are using Google Tag Manager.

# Installation

## Using CocoaPods

In your Podfile add this line:

`pod 'XZDataLayerViewer'`

## Old School

Just add the files in `Sources` and import `XZDataLayerViewer.h` in your AppDelegate.

# Usage

```
// AppDelegate.m

#import "XZDataLayerViewer.h"

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [XZDataLayerViewer configureWithTagManger:[TAGManager instance] store:XZDefaultStore eventGenerator:XZDefaultObserver maxHistoryItems:100];
    // ...
    UIViewController *dataLayerViewerInterface = [[XZDataLayerViewer sharedInstance] viewerInterface];
	[yourViewController presentViewController:dataLayerViewerInterface animated:YES completion:nil];
}

```

# Extending

## Data storage

By default library uses in memory storage. You may implement your own store conforming to XZStoreProtocol and write data to file or server.

## When data stored

By default library observers every push to Google Tag Manager data layer and saves data layer state in storage. If you want to do this in other moments you should implement your own observer that conforms to XZEventGeneratorProtocol
